                    Like many of our Breezy Point neighbors, we've made this city our home for its friendly and peaceful neighborhoods, surrounded by breathtaking nature. While some of us may prefer to avoid local politics, it's crucial to stay informed about our city's happenings. That's where Breezy Point Neighborhood Alliance comes in. We're here to provide a concise, monthly update on city activities along with occasional surveys to gather resident feedback. Subscribe below and join the alliance!
